Welcome to Ghosting, a Snapchat clone built using React.js, featuring a camera, Redux and Firebase integration. 

### Introduction
Ghosting is a project aimed at replicating the functionality of Snapchat using React.js, Redux for state management and Firebase for real-time data syncrhonization.
The project showcases how to integrate a camera feature, manage application state efficiently with Redux, and utilise Firebase for seamless data storage and retrieval.

### Features
* **Camera Integration:** Capture photos and videos directly within the application using the integrated camera feature.
* **Real-time Updates:** Leverage Firebase to achieve real-time updates and synchronisation of messages across multiple devices.
* **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to ensure secure access to the application.
* **Snapchat-Like Experience:** Mimic the user experience of Snapchat with disappearing messages and a user-friendly interface.

### Technologies Used
* **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a robust foundation for creating a dynamic and responsive application.
* **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript applications, enabling efficient state management in large and complex applications.
* **Firebase:** A comprehensive backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform, used for real-time data synchronisation, authentication and storage.
* **Other Dependencies:** Various additional libraries and tools will be used to enhance the development process. Refer to the project documentation for detailed information.
